Pong Atari 1972

Pong was the first game developed by Atari. Company founder Nolan Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn because of his background in electrical engineering and computer science, having previously worked together at Ampex. Alcorn had no experience with video games, so Pong was a training project for him. In their memoirs, the developers disagree on what became the prototype of the game, a game for the PDP-1 computer (1964) or a game for the Magnavox Odyssey (1972).

Allan Alcorn felt that the game's prototype was too simple because the ball always bounced at the same angle. In Pong, each paddle was no longer monolithic and consisted of eight segments. The ball in the game, depending on how it hits different places on the paddle, began to behave differently: when it hits the center of the paddle, it bounces according to the angle of reflection, further from the center it ricochets at a smaller angle, and when it hits the margin segments, the ball bounces in the opposite direction. The original game played at a constant speed, which Allan Alcorn found boring. So he added acceleration to the ball so that it would move faster and faster over time. Thanks to the innovations, the gameplay of Pong has changed - it has become more strategy-oriented and began to resemble squash rather than ping-pong. One technical quirk in Pong was that the paddles couldn't reach the top of the screen. This was due to technical limitations due to the use of simple chips, but Alcorn decided to turn the bug into a feature, and it became a feature of the game in the expectation that two experienced players would not be able to play forever.

During development, it was decided that the game would have realistic sound effects and a roaring crowd, so that the game would "boo" and "hiss" at the player when they lose a round. Alcorn had limited space to accommodate the necessary electronics and did not know how to create such sounds using digital circuitry. After testing clock generators, he discovered that they could generate different tones of sound signals and used them to produce sound effects.

The game became very popular for many decades. Coin-operated slot machines in bars and game rooms overflowed, boys invited girls to play Pong and became couples. Atari produced many home game consoles, and the game was copied by many home game console and computer manufacturers.

Based on the description given, we reproduced the behavior of Pong Atari 1972, keeping in mind the requirement of the subject that “but in any case, it must be faithful to the original Pong (1972).”
